# Get_Crypto_Price
This is fun python project that get real-time crypto currency price from coin around the world

# Coingecko
Coingecko is powerful api that gather cryptocurrency information from all around the world so let start to use them ^^ (On top of that  it is free for everyone !!)

# Library that I used:
1. urllib.request - to request information from website 
2. json - to covert json to dictionary data in python

# How to use ?
Before using this python they will ask you 2 question:

First: Currency that you want them to show. You should input it in symbol of currency such as usd for US Dollar, thb for Thai baht.

Second: Crypto currency symbol such as BNB, BTC and ETH etc.., If this symbol is in Coingecko database, it should give you a current price. If not, Good luck !!

For example, 
- I want currency in Thai baht I will input __(thb)__
- and I want to know current bitcoin price I will put __(btc)__

If you don't sure about Symbol you can check with https://www.coingecko.com/en

# Hope You Enjoy it !!
